00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>The year, 1462.</i>

3
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,640
<i>Constantinople had fallen.</i>

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,440
<i>Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast, superior force...</i>

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,480
<i>striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.</i>

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,000
<i>From Transylvania
arose a Romanian knight...</i>

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,200
<i>of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.</i>

8
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
<i>On the eve of the battle...</i>

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,640
<i>his bride Elisabeta...</i>

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,800
<i>whom he prized
above all things on Earth...</i>

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>knew that he must face
an insurmountable force...</i>

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,520
<i>from which he might never return.</i>

13
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,880
Elisabeta.

14
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,320
<i>The vengeful Turks
shot an arrow into the castle...</i>

15
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,560
<i>carrying false news
of Dracula's death.</i>

16
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,320
<i>Elisabeta, believing him dead...</i>

17
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
<i>flung herself into the river.</i>

18
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,760
<i>My prince is dead.</i>

19
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,880
<i>All is lost without him.</i>

20
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,640
<i>May God unite us in heaven.</i>

21
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,440
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

22
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,400
All the preparations
are in order.

23
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,160
Everything.

24
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,880
I await your command.

25
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,560
For I know...

26
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,760
that when the rewards
are given...

27
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,320
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

28
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Thank you.

29
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,480
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

30
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

31
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,880
I want you to take over
for his foreign client...

32
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
this rather eccentric
Count Dracula.

33
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,200
- He's buying up property around London.
- Of course, sir.

34
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

35
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,080
This is a great opportunity
for you, Harker.

36
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,200
But you'll have to leave
for Transylvania immediately.

37
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,800
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

38
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,160
Yes, of course, sir.

39
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
If I may inquire...

40
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,520
what, in fact, happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

41
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Nothing. Nothing.

42
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,560
Personal problems.

43
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
Close these transactions...

44
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,640
and your future with this firm
is assured.

45
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

46
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,960
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

47
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,200
We can be married when I return.

48
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,480
Of course.

49
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,840
I'll write.

50
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Jonathan.

51
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
Jonathan, I love you.

52
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
I love you, Mina.

53
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,280
<i>25th May, Budapest.</i>

54
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,640
<i>Left Budapest early this morning.</i>

55
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,440
<i>The impression I had
was that we were leaving the west...</i>

56
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,800
<i>The district I am to enter
is in the extreme east of the country...</i>

57
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,520
<i>just on the borders
of three states...</i>

58
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,160
<i>Transylvania, Moldavia
and Bukovina...</i>

59
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,360
<i>in the midst
of the Carpathian Mountains...</i>

60
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,720
<i>one of the wildest
and least known portions of Europe.</i>

61
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,760
<i>"My friend...</i>

62
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>welcome to the Carpathians.</i>

63
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
<i>I am anxiously expecting you.</i>

64
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,240
<i>At the Borgo Pass...</i>

65
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,880
<i>my carriage will await you
and bring you to me.</i>

66
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,680
<i>I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one...</i>

67
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,480
<i>and that you
will enjoy your stay...</i>

68
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>in my beautiful land.</i>

69
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,440
<i>Your friend, D."</i>

70
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,120
<i>Diary, 25th May.</i>

71
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,240
<i>And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...</i>

72
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,520
<i>I am happy that he got sent
on this important assignment.</i>

73
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,360
<i>I am longing to hear
all the news.</i>

74
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,240
<i>It must be so nice
to see strange countries.</i>

75
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,360
<i>I wonder if we...
I mean Jonathan and I...</i>

76
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
<i>shall ever see them together.</i>

77
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,360
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

78
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,640
I say, is the castle far?

79
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,880
Welcome to my home.

80
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,040
Enter freely of your own will...

81
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,960
and leave some of
the happiness you bring.

82
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,880
Count Dracula?

83
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,800
I am...

84
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,840
Dracula.

85
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,560
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

86
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
Come in.

87
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,760
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

88
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,000
do not join you.

89
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,320
But I have already dined.

90
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,960
And I never drink...

91
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,360
wine.

92
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,280
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

93
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,080
The Order of the Dracul.

94
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,520
The Dragon.

95
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,960
An ancient society...

96
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,600
pledging my forefathers...

97
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,640
to defend their church
against all enemies of Christ.

98
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,400
That relationship
was not entirely...

99
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,800
successful.

100
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,560
Oh, yes.

101
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,200
It is no laughing matter.

102
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,720
We Draculs
have a right to be proud.

103
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,680
What devil or witch
was ever so great as Attila...

104
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,960
whose blood flows
in these veins?

105
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,160
Blood...

106
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,720
is too precious a thing
in these times.

107
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,000
The warlike days are over.

108
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,080
The victories of my great race...

109
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,800
are but a tale to be told.

110
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
I am the last of my kind.

111
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,080
I have offended you
with my ignorance, Count.

112
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,560
Forgive me.

113
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,640
I do so long to go
through the crowded streets...

114
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,920
of your mighty land...

115
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,600
to be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity...

116
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,960
to share its life...

117
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,040
its changes, its death.

118
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,400
There.
You, Count, are...

119
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,320
are the owner of
Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

120
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Congratulations.

121
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,360
Your firm writes most highly...

122
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,840
of your talents.

123
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,640
They say you are a man of good...

124
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,160
taste.

125
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
And that you are
a worthy substitute...

126
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,240
"Society Of Solicitors - R.M. Renfield"
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

127
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,920
You may rely on me, Count.

128
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,680
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

129
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,920
in such precise locations
around London?

130
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,040
Is it to raise the market value?

131
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,080
Do you believe in destiny?

132
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,360
That even the powers of time...

133
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,560
can be altered
for a single purpose?

134
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,920
The luckiest man
who walks on this Earth...

135
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,080
is the one who finds...

136
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,400
true love.

137
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,160
You found Mina.

138
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,560
I thought she was lost.

139
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,760
We're to be married
as soon as I return.

140
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Are you married, Count?

141
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,240
Sir...

142
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,160
are you married?

143
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,320
I was married once.

144
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,520
Ages ago, it seems.

145
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,600
She died.

146
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm very sorry.

147
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,200
She was fortunate.

148
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,080
My life, at its best, is misery.

149
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,360
She will no doubt
make a devoted wife.

150
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,120
And you a faithful husband.

151
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
Come.

152
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,720
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

153
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,560
and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

154
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,680
to stay with me...

155
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,720
until a month from now.

156
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,720
A month?

157
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,880
Do you wish me to stay so long?

158
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,280
I will take no refusal.

159
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>Diary, 30th of May, 1897.</i>

160
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,120
<i>I know that Jonathan does not want me
to stay here with Lucy while he is away.</i>

161
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,400
<i>He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...</i>

162
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,200
<i>I will not be content as the wife
of a mere clerk in a law firm.</i>

163
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
<i>But Lucy and I have been friends
since we were children...</i>

164
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,120
<i>and she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.</i>

165
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
How disgustingly awful.

166
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
Mina!

167
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

168
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,840
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

169
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,480
forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

170
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,800
When he could be forcing you
to perform...

171
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,920
unspeakable acts of desperate passion
on the parlor floor.

172
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,560
Lucy, really.

173
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,440
You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

174
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,840
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasure.

175
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,800
Oh, Mina.
So I see.

176
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,200
Much, much more.

177
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,080
That's...

178
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,840
What is it, Lucy?

179
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,280
Because I don't understand it.

180
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,080
Can a man and woman really do...

181
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,040
that?

182
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,600
I did, only last night.

183
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,320
- Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

184
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,440
Well, in my dreams.

185
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,320
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

186
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
You can tell Lucy.

187
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,720
We've kissed. That's all.

188
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,440
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

189
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,160
And it's all the worse now that
I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

190
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,840
my rich friend.

191
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,320
Yes, but not even
one marriage proposal.

192
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,720
And here I am, almost 20...

193
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,960
practically a hag.

194
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,320
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

195
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

196
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,520
A Texan.

197
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,640
Quincey P. Morris.

198
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,480
He's so young and fresh...

199
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,720
like a wild stallion
between my legs.

200
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,760
You're positively indecent.

201
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,320
I just know what men desire.

202
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,040
Watch.

203
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,600
- Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

204
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,520
Why, you're as fresh
as the spring rain.

205
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh, thank you.

206
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,720
Please let me touch it.

207
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,600
It's so big.

208
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,040
Little girl.

209
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,200
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

210
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,400
I hold your hand...

211
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,640
- and you've kissed me.
- Jack!

212
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,360
Oceans of love...
Oh, Jack, my darling.

213
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,080
Poor little baby.

214
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,040
My kitten, come over here.

215
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,280
Come over here
and I'll kiss it better.

216
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,560
My poor little blossom.

217
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,680
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

218
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,640
- Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

219
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,960
What a naughty bear.
Let me...

220
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,080
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur!

221
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,120
Oh, my darling.

222
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Oh, you look wonderful.

223
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm so sorry about your hat.

224
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
- Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

225
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,760
Is it really?

226
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,520
<i>Lucy is a pure
and virtuous girl...</i>

227
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.</i>

228
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,560
<i>Jonathan says it is a defect
of the aristocracy...</i>

229
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
<i>that they say what they please.</i>

230
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>The truth is that I admire Lucy, and I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.</i>

231
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,800
<i>I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.</i>

232
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,320
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

233
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,040
respected member of
the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

234
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,400
returns from business abroad
in Transylvania...

235
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,400
promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

236
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,640
<i>He's now obsessed
with some blood lust.</i>

237
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
George.

238
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,200
Wait here.

239
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Would you care for
an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

240
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,840
or a canapé?

241
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,320
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

242
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,960
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

243
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,880
Is my personal life
of interest to you?

244
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,760
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

245
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,720
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

246
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,120
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

247
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,960
You see,
each life that I ingest...

248
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,160
gives back life to me.

249
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,440
A fly gives you life?

250
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,280
Certainly.

251
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,280
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

252
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,040
than to interest me
in a lesser carnivore.

253
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,560
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

254
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,720
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

255
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,320
Yes, spiders eat them.

256
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,720
What about sparrows?

257
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,040
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

258
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
- Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

259
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,520
A kitten.

260
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,200
I beg you.

261
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,160
A little, sleek...
a playful kitten.

262
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

263
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,440
No one would refuse me a kitten.

264
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

265
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,440
Oh, yes.

266
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,560
A big cat.

267
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,520
- My salvation depends upon it!
- Your salvation?

268
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Yes. I need lives.

269
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,800
- I need lives for the master.
- What master?

270
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,720
The master will come...

271
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,800
and he has promised
to make me immortal.

272
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,360
How?

273
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,520
Get him off!

274
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,080
The blood is the life!

275
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
The blood is the life!

276
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,400
<i>30th May, Castle Dracula.</i>

277
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,720
<i>I think strange things which
I dare not confess to my own soul.</i>

278
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
<i>The count...</i>

279
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,560
<i>the way he looked at Mina's picture
fills me with dread...</i>

280
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,440
<i>as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.</i>

281
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,600
I didn't hear you come in.

282
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Take care how you cut yourself.

283
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,280
It is more dangerous
than you think.

284
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,240
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

285
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,600
Perhaps you should...

286
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,760
grow a beard.

287
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,760
The letters I requested.

288
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
Have you written them?

289
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,320
Good.

290
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,320
Should you leave these rooms...

291
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,840
you will not, by any chance...

292
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,080
go to sleep in any other
part of the castle.

293
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,840
It is old...

294
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,800
and has many bad memories.

295
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,240
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

296
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,320
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

297
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
We are in Transylvania.

298
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,480
Transylvania is not England.

299
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,680
Our ways are not your ways.

300
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
And to you...

301
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,040
there shall be
many strange things.

302
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,320
I've seen many
strange things already.

303
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,520
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

304
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,400
Listen to them.

305
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,480
The children of the night.

306
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,680
What sweet music they make.

307
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,680
Music? Those animals?

308
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,560
<i>I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.</i>

309
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,000
<i>To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.</i>

310
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,920
<i>I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.</i>

311
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,440
<i>I know now that I am a prisoner.</i>

312
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,000
<i>Jonathan.</i>

313
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,440
<i>Jonathan, come to me.</i>

314
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
<i>Come.</i>

315
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,840
<i>Lay down.</i>

316
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,040
<i>Lay back into my arms.</i>

317
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,560
<i>Lay back, Jonathan.</i>

318
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,920
<i>"Dearest Mina,
all is well here.</i>

319
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,800
<i>The count has insisted
I remain for a month...</i>

320
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,120
<i>to tutor him in English custom.</i>

321
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,480
<i>I can say no more,
except I love you.</i>

322
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,200
<i>Ever faithful, Jonathan."</i>

323
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,920
<i>The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.</i>

324
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,360
<i>The count's gypsies...</i>

<i>They are to be delivered to his
newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.</i>

329
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,160
<i>Why do they
fill these boxes with earth?</i>

330
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,640
I love him! I love him!

331
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,480
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

332
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,000
I love him
and I've said yes.

333
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,480
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

334
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

335
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,280
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

336
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,080
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

337
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,240
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

338
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
You don't seem to care.

339
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,840
It's just that I'm
so terribly worried about Jonathan.

340
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,080
This letter I received is so...

341
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,480
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

342
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
Mina, don't worry.

343
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,920
<i>Captain's log: the Demeter.</i>

344
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,560
<i>"Captain's Log - Demeter

<i>We picked up 50 boxes

The master of all life is at hand!

355
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,440
Gather round!

356
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,960
I am here to do
your bidding, master!

357
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,360
I have worshipped you
long and far off!

358
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,800
And now you are near, master!

359
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,480
I am your slave!

360
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,120
I await your command!

361
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
The case of Renfield
grows more interesting.

362
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,720
Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

363
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,920
Had I the secret of even
one such brilliant mind...

364
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,680
the key to the fancy
of one lunatic...

365
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,800
Lucy.

366
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,160
Lucy? Lucy!

367
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,960
No. Do not see me.

368
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Oh! I couldn't control myself.

369
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,680
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

370
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,680
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

371
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,320
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

372
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,800
I'm absolutely shaking.

373
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,760
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

374
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,040
I had to. It sort of
pulled me and lured me.

375
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,160
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

376
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,120
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

377
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,120
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

378
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,880
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

379
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
Master.

380
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,120
Master! I am here!

381
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,720
I have worshipped you.

382
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,320
<i>Contrary to some beliefs,

384

<i>though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.</i>

385
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,520
See the amazing cinematograph!

386
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,520
A wonder of modern civilization!

387
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,800
The latest sensation!

388
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,840
The greatest attraction
of the century!

389
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,600
The new wonder of the world!

390
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,800
See me.

391
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,760
See me now.

392
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,360
Escaped wolf from zoo
still at large!

393
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,280
Buy a paper, sir?

394
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,960
Thank you, sir.

395
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,720
Get your Gazette!
Penny a paper!

396
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,840
My humblest apologies.

397
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,840
Forgive my ignorance.

398
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,880
I am recently arrived
from abroad...

399
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,920
and I do not know your city.

400
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,760
- Is a beautiful lady...
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

401
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,400
I have offended you.

402
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,120
I am only looking for
the cinematograph.

403
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,600
I understand it is a wonder
of the civilized world.

404
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,320
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

405
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,200
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

406
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,720
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

407
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,280
should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

408
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,520
Do I know you, sir?

409
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,520
Are you acquainted
with my husband?

410
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,440
Shall I call the police?

411
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,320
Husband?

412
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,760
I shall bother you no more.

413
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,880
Sir.

414
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,560
It is I who have been rude.

415
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,320
- If you're looking...
- Please.

416
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,080
Permit me to introduce myself.

417
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,920
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

418
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,720
- A prince, no less?
- I am...

419
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,120
your servant.

420
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,800
Wilhelmina Murray.

421
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,240
I am...

422
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,320
honored...

423
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,240
Madam Mina.

424
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,720
This way.

425
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
Hello, sir.

426
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,600
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

427
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,120
Yes, sir.

428
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,840
- Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

429
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,520
Oh, Jack!

430
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,720
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

431
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,400
Did Arthur put you up to this...

432
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,720
or did you want me alone just once
before I'm married?

433
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,200
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

434
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,960
I'm here as your doctor.

435
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,200
Your fiancé
is very worried about you...

436
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,960
and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

437
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,080
I must have your complete trust.

438
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,400
Help me, Jack.

439
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,400
I don't know
what's happening to me.

440
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,560
I'm changing.

441
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,480
I can feel it.

442
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,800
I can hear everything.

443
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,840
I hear the servants at the other
end of the house, whispering.

444
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,080
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

445
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,760
But I'm having horrible
nightmares, Jack.

446
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,320
The eyes.

447
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,760
Oh, Jack.

448
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

449
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,600
Let it work.

450
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,720
- Thank you.
- Lucy.

451
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,120
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

452
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,840
And may I say, Miss Lucy
is hotter than a June bride...

453
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,240
ridin' bareback
buck naked in the Sahara.

454
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,880
I would watch my colonial tongue
if I were you.

455
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,800
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

456
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,520
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

457
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,200
Jack, are you still
broodin' over Miss Lucy?

458
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,720
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

459
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,160
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

460
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,680
Last week he wanted to marry her,
and now he wants to have her committed.

461
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,400
Let's have a look at her.

462
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,640
I'm at a loss, I admit.

463
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,320
I've taken the liberty
of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

464
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,320
the metaphysician/philosopher.

465
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,160
Sounds like a goddamn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

466
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,960
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

467
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,160
He's my teacher and mentor.

468
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,360
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

469
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,320
Spare no expense.

470
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,400
Astounding.

471
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,160
There are no limits to science.

472
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,480
How can you call this science?

473
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,720
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

474
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,360
Really.

475
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,560
I shouldn't have come here.

476
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,520
I must go.

477
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,400
Do not fear me.

478
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,060
Stop this. Stop this...

479
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,640
My God. Who are you?

480
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,400
I know you.

481
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,920
I have crossed oceans of time...

482
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,840
to find you.

483
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
There is no need to panic.

484
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,960
The animal handlers have
everything under complete control.

485
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,120
Come here, Mina.

486
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,120
He likes you.

487
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,440
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

488
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,520
<i>"A dear friend near death;</i>

489
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,400
<i>disease of the blood
unknown to all medical theory.</i>

490
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,240
<i>I am in desperate need.
Jack Seward."</i>

491
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,760
The tropical pampas vampire bat
must...

492
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,440
consume ten times its own weight
in fresh blood each day...

493
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,920
or its own blood cells will die.

494
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,560
Cute little vermin, <i>ja</i>?

495
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,200
Blood and the diseases
of the blood...

496
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,960
such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

497
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,240
The very name
"venereal diseases"...

498
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,880
the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

499
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,280
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which...

500
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,320
the ethics and ideals
of Christian civilization are concerned.

501
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,280
In fact, civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

502
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,920
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

503
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,840
Telegraph?

504
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,920
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

505
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,440
<i>Dawn.</i>

506
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,320
<i>These may be the last words
I write in this journal.</i>

507
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,000
<i>Dracula has left me
with these women...</i>

508
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,120
<i>these devils of the pit.</i>

509
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,360
<i>They drain my blood
to keep me weak...</i>

510
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,120
<i>barely alive so I cannot escape.</i>

511
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,480
<i>I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.</i>

512
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,360
<i>There must be passageway
to the river...</i>

513
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,800
<i>and then away
from this cursed land...</i>

514
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,960
<i>where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.</i>

515
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,880
<i>For the record, I do attest...</i>

516
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,120
<i>that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...</i>

517
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,960
<i>became personally involved
in these strange events.</i>

518
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,640
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

519
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,320
I always come to my friends in need
when they call me.

520
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,800
So, Jack, tell me everything
about your case.

521
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,720
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

522
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,880
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

523
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,400
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

524
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,360
Blood loss? How?

525
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,600
My God, close the doors!

526
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,800
My God...

527
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,920
she's only a child.

528
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,880
<i>Ja.</i>

529
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,040
My God.

530
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,040
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

531
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,720
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

532
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,160
- Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

533
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,600
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

534
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,520
Landsteiner's method.

535
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,400
Animals, goats, sheeps.

536
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,880
If hemolysis occurs
in the blood donor serum...

537
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,640
her red blood cells will explode.

538
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,960
She will die.
Take this tube.

539
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,840
What in God's name
is going on up here?

540
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,760
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

541
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,240
- What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

542
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,760
- Good God!
- You're the fiancé? Please.

543
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,040
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

544
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,120
She wants blood
and blood she must have.

545
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,600
Take off your coat.

546
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,520
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

547
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,080
- Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

548
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,720
Roll it up!

549
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,520
This may hurt a little, Art.

550
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,200
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

551
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,160
Your last drop?

552
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,880
Thank you.

553
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,240
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

554
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,680
Hold her hand.

555
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,960
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

556
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,360
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

557
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,520
- What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

558
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,800
Those marks on her throat...

559
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,240
no disease, no trituration...

560
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,160
I am sure the blood loss
occurred there.

561
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,080
Oh? Where did the blood go?

562
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,800
You were once
a careful student, Jack.

563
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,720
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go?

564
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,160
Tell me!

565
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,440
- The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

566
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,880
You do not let your eyes see
nor your ears hear...

567
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,240
that which you cannot account for.

568
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,160
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

569
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,400
<i>Ja.</i> Why not?

570
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,640
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

571
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,800
Will one of you learned doctors...
or whatever you are...

572
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,760
kindly tell me
what is going on with my Lucy?

573
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,640
Jack, you are a scientist.

574
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,000
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

575
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,520
and which are true...
mesmerism, hypnotism?

576
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,680
You and Charcot
have proved hypnotism.

577
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,160
Materialization, astral bodies.

578
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,400
Professor?

579
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,120
Where did he go?

580
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,000
You see?

581
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,440
I feel like a blundering novice.

582
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,000
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

583
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,080
Those marks on your dear
Miss Lucy's neck were made...

584
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,280
by something unspeakable
out there.

585
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,560
Dead, but not dead.

586
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,680
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not comprehend.

587
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,760
To live, it feeds
on Lucy's precious blood.

588
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,200
It is a beast, a monster.

589
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,120
<i>What is happening
to Lucy and to me?</i>

590
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,320
<i>When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.</i>

591
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,680
<i>I wish I were myself again...</i>

592
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,360
<i>the sensible Mina
I always depended on.</i>

593
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,560
<i>Absinthe...</i>

594
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,040
<i>is the aphrodisiac of the self.</i>

595
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,320
<i>The green fairy...</i>

596
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,040
<i>who lives in the absinthe...</i>

597
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,960
<i>wants your soul.</i>

598
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,000
<i>But...</i>

599
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,160
<i>you are safe with me.</i>

600
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,560
Tell me, Prince...

601
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,640
tell me of your home.

602
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,320
The most beautiful place...

603
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,240
in all creation.

604
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,720
Yes, it must be.

605
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,240
A land beyond
a great, vast forest...

606
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,360
surrounded by
majestic mountains...

607
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,000
lush vineyards...

608
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,320
and flowers of such frailty
and beauty...

609
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,720
as to be found nowhere else.

610
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,040
You've described my home...

611
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,240
as if you had seen it firsthand.

612
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,160
It's your voice, perhaps.

613
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,080
It's so familiar.

614
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,880
It's like...

615
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,880
It's like a voice in a dream
I cannot place...

616
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,200
and it comforts me.

617
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,680
- When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

618
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,680
And what of the princess?

619
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,760
Princess?

620
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,680
There is always a princess...

621
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,080
with gowns flowing white.

622
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,120
And her face.

623
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,160
Oh, God...

624
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,080
her face...

625
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,200
is a river.

626
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,160
The princess...

627
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,560
she's a river
filled with tears of sadness...

628
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,840
and heartbreak.

629
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,800
There was a princess.

630
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,040
Elisabeta.

631
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,440
She was the most radiant woman...

632
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,520
in all the empires of the world.

633
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,240
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

634
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,040
She leapt to her death...

635
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,440
into the river that you spoke of.

636
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,280
In my mother's tongue...

637
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,560
it is called...

638
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,760
<i>Argesh.</i>

639
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,600
River princess.

640
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,400
<i>Dear Madam.</i>

641
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,600
<i>Your fiancé is safe and in the care...</i>

642
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,920
<i>of the good sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament.</i>

643
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,520
<i>Mr. Harker believes your life
is in extreme danger...</i>

644
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,920
<i>and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here...</i>

645
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,040
<i>so that you may
immediately be married.</i>

646
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,640
<i>Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.</i>

647
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,800
My sweet prince.

648
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,400
Jonathan must never know of us.

649
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,240
- Lucy...
- Abraham Van Helsing.

650
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,520
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, <i>ja?</i>

651
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,720
- How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

652
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,000
She tells me of your
beloved Jonathan Harker...

653
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,200
and your worry for him.

654
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,360
Well, I, too, worry
for all young lovers.

655
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,240
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

656
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,400
and there are lights.

657
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,200
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

658
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,280
the light of all light.

659
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,200
Go now.
See your friend.

660
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,080
You look different.

661
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,200
You look positively radiant.

662
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,760
You heard from Jonathan.

663
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,920
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

664
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,520
He's safe.

665
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,240
He's in a convent in Romania.

666
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,640
He's suffering
from a violent brain fever.

667
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,400
The good sisters
are caring for him.

668
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,960
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

669
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,040
but I won't go.

670
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,280
I'm not going to leave you.

671
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,920
You've got to go to him...

672
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,480
and you've got to love him...

673
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,640
and marry him
right then and there.

674
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,600
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

675
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,560
It's my wedding gift to you.

676
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,840
Don't worry about
spoiled little Lucy.

677
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,480
I'll be all right.

678
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,440
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

679
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,480
Jack, how is she?

680
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,480
This is why I cannot breathe!

681
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,480
Lucy, it's medicinal.

682
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,800
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

683
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,840
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

684
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,120
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

685
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,800
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

686
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,640
Arthur sent me
to take care of you.

687
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,160
He said
if you don't get better quick...

688
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,160
I have to put you out of your misery
like a lame horse.

689
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,360
You're such a beast.

690
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,400
Will you kiss me?

691
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,680
Kiss me.

692
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,680
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

693
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,040
Listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

694
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
You're at peace.

695
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,760
Look. There. There.

696
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,480
<i>Nosferatu.</i>

697
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,360
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history...

698
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,280
of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula...

699
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,600
How he impaled people
and roasted them...

700
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,240
boiled their heads in a kettle...

701
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,600
how he skinned them alive...

702
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,160
and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

703
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,600
Dracul.

704
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,120
For blood is the life.

705
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,520
<i>"My dearest Prince, forgive me.</i>

706
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,040
<i>I have received word
from my fiancé in Romania.</i>

707
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,240
<i>I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.</i>

708
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,680
<i>I will never see you again.</i>

709
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,440
<i>Mina."</i>

710
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,000
<i>It is odd,
but I feel almost...</i>

711
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,640
<i>that my strange friend
is with me.</i>

712
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,520
<i>He speaks to me in my thoughts.</i>

713
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,600
<i>With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.</i>

714
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,520
<i>And now without him,
soon to be a bride...</i>

715
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,280
<i>I feel confused and lost.</i>

716
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,240
<i>Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.</i>

717
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,200
<i>Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.</i>

718
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,840
Winds!

719
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,440
It is the cause.

720
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,160
It is the cause of my soul!

721
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,640
It is Dracula...

722
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,800
the undead...

723
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,800
the foe I have pursued
all my life.

724
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,480
Dracula!

725
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,280
Jack, hurry!
I have much to tell you.

726
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,760
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

727
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,200
Do not fail here tonight.

728
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,200
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience...

729
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,280
an enormous power,
so guard her well.

730
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,880
Otherwise your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil...

731
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,800
a whore of darkness!

732
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,160
You're a sick old buzzard.

733
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,560
Hear me out, young man.

734
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,000
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

735
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,680
Do you understand? No.

736
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,800
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

737
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,320
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

738
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,800
She is the devil's concubine!

739
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,720
Do you understand me?

740
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,440
Yet, we may still save
her precious soul.

741
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,120
But not on an empty stomach.

742
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,400
- Jack!
- Here, sir.

743
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,120
I starve. Feed me.

744
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,600
You old coot!

745
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,240
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells...

746
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,240
cannot protect you
from my power.

747
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,560
I condemn you to living death...

748
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,720
to eternal hunger...

749
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,920
for living blood.

750
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,480
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

751
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,680
Believe?
How can I believe?

752
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,400
I want you to bring me, before
nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

753
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,480
An autopsy? Lucy?

754
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,000
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off
her head and take out her heart.

755
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,480
<i>Diary, 17th September.</i>

756
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,080
<i>Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.</i>

757
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,360
<i>He's cheered by
the familiar streets in London.</i>

758
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,440
<i>For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.</i>

759
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,040
<i>It is as if a part of me
is dead too...</i>

760
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,840
<i>except for the tiny hope
that lives in me...</i>

761
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,360
<i>that I will again
see my prince.</i>

762
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,320
<i>Is he here?</i>

763
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,920
<i>Now that I am married...</i>

764
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
<i>I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend...</i>

765
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,400
<i>who is always in my thoughts.</i>

766
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,040
Jonathan, what is it?

767
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,000
It is the man himself.

768
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,160
Look, he's grown young.

769
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:36,280
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

770
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,240
She died horribly enough.

771
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,800
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

772
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,360
But if she's not dead...

773
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,840
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

774
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,800
No. All I say is
she is undead.

775
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,000
Undead.

776
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,840
This is insane.

777
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,440
Gentlemen, shall we?

778
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,400
One, two, three.

779
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,400
Where is she?

780
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,520
What have you done with her?

781
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,680
She lives beyond
the grace of God...

782
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,920
a wanderer in the outer darkness.

783
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,840
She is vampyre, <i>nosferatu.</i>

784
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,800
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting...

785
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,200
but instead grow strong
and become immortal...

786
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,320
once infected
by another <i>nosferatu.</i>

787
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,440
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

788
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,840
but legions that go on
age after age after age...

789
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,880
feeding on the blood
of the living.

790
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,240
Quickly, hide. Now.

791
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,760
Come to me, Arthur.

792
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,800
Leave these others
and come to me.

793
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,680
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

794
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,200
Kiss me and caress me...

795
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,600
my darling husband, please.

796
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,280
We wave Christ
and His holy blood!

797
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,880
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of His might!

798
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,160
The power of God is upon us!

799
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,280
I bring you from shadow
into light!

800
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,400
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

801
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,520
into hell!

802
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,880
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

803
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,800
Take the stake
in your left hand...

804
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,440
place the point over the heart.

805
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,600
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now!

806
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,360
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength
for the dark days ahead.

807
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,880
- Doctor?
<i>- Ja?</i>

808
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,480
How did Lucy die?

809
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,640
Well...

810
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,960
Was she in great pain?

811
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,640
<i>Ja</i>, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

812
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,840
and drove a stake through her heart
and burned it and then she found peace.

813
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,120
Doctor! Please.

814
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,640
So, Mr. Harker...

815
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,520
I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

816
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,000
a sensitive question.

817
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,560
During your infidelity
with those creatures...

818
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,160
those demonic women...

819
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,480
did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

820
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,840
Good!

821
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,400
Then you have not infected your blood
with the terrible...

822
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,800
disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

823
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,480
Doctor, you must understand.

824
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,480
I doubted everything...

825
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,200
even my mind.

826
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,280
I was impotent with fear.

827
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,120
- I know.
- But, sir...

828
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,880
I know where the bastard sleeps.

829
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,480
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

830
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,680
Vampires do exist.

831
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,800
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

832
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,360
has the strength
of 20 or more people...

833
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,440
and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

834
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,520
<i>But he can also control
the meaner things of life...</i>

835
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,640
<i>the bat, the rodent, the wolf.</i>

836
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:17,760
<i>He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog
and vanish at will.</i>

837
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,280
Now, all these things
Dracula can do...

838
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,040
but he is not free.

839
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,400
He must rest in the sacred earth
of his homeland to gain his evil power.

840
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,240
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly.

841
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,240
I almost feel pity for anything
so hunted as this count.

842
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,480
How can you pity
such a creature?

843
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,560
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

844
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,000
Good. You'll be safer there.

845
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,840
Mr. Morris, your bullets
will not harm him.

846
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,200
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

847
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,080
Well, I wasn't plannin'
on getting that close, Doc.

848
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,800
Master!

849
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,040
Dr. Jack!

850
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,920
I've been promised eternal life!

851
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,720
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

852
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,280
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

853
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,400
Renfield? I must see him.

854
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,800
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

855
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,960
This is Mrs. Harker.

856
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:39,320
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

857
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,960
It seems I've been
rather naughty.

858
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,240
I know you.

859
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,160
You're the bride
my master covets.

860
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,240
I have a husband.

861
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,840
I am Mrs. Harker.

862
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,800
My master tells me about you.

863
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,280
What does he tell you?

864
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,680
That he is coming.

865
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,480
That he is coming for you.

866
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,360
Oh, please.

867
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,160
Don't stay here.

868
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:22,960
Get away from these men, please.

869
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:28,040
And I pray to God
I may never see your sweet face again.

870
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,040
And may the Lord bless
and keep you.

871
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,440
Master! Master!

872
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,120
You promised me eternal life...

873
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,520
but you give it
to the pretty woman!

874
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,600
Dr. Jack!

875
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,600
I'm no lunatic man!

876
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,560
I'm a sane man
fighting for his soul!

877
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,400
My quarters are spare, but I think
you will find them comfortable.

878
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,360
Dr. Jack!

879
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,080
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

880
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,680
You'll be completely safe here.

881
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,720
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

882
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,680
Leave him no refuge.

883
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,120
Let the exorcism begin.

884
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,240
You have betrayed me.

885
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,880
No, master.

886
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,200
I serve you.

887
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,040
I serve only you.

888
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,200
Oh, yes, my love.

889
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,600
You've found me.

890
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,040
My most precious life.

891
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,120
I have wanted this to happen.

892
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,040
I know that now.

893
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,200
I want to be with you always.

894
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:28,720
You cannot know
what you are saying.

895
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,760
Yes...

896
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,880
I do know.

897
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:49,160
I feared I would never feel
your touch again.

898
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,080
I thought you were dead.

899
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,880
There is no life in this body.

900
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,680
But you live.

901
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,200
You live.

902
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,680
What are you?

903
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,920
I must know.
You must tell me.

904
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,800
I am...

905
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,400
nothing.

906
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,840
Lifeless.

907
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,760
- Soulless.
- What do you mean?

908
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,680
Hated and feared.

909
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,720
I am dead to all the world.

910
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,640
Hear me.

911
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,560
I am the monster...

912
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,640
that breathing men would kill.

913
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,480
I am Dracula.

914
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,680
You murdered Lucy!

915
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,200
I love you.

916
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,680
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

917
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,080
I want to be what you are...

918
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,560
see what you see...

919
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,480
love what you love.

920
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,440
To walk with me...

921
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,680
you must die
to your breathing life...

922
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,840
and be reborn to mine.

923
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,080
You are my love...

924
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,680
and my life always.

925
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,080
Then...

926
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,480
I give you life eternal...

927
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,080
everlasting love...

928
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:35,320
the power of the storm...

929
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,960
and the beasts of the earth.

930
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,200
Walk with me...

931
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,920
to be my loving wife forever.

932
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,680
I will. Yes. Yes.

933
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,280
Drink and join me...

934
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,680
in eternal life.

935
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,680
I cannot let this be.

936
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,480
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

937
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,520
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death...

938
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,360
for all eternity.

939
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,040
I love you too much...

940
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,560
to condemn you.

941
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:01,560
Then take me away
from all this death.

942
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,720
You think you can destroy me...

943
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,080
with your idols?

944
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,480
Sacred blood of Christ!

945
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,440
I, who served the cross.

946
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,840
I, who commanded nations...

947
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,880
hundreds of years
before you were born.

948
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,960
Your armies were defeated.

949
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:21,880
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

950
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,040
I was betrayed.

951
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,000
Look what your God...

952
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,800
has done to me.

953
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,800
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

954
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,280
Christ compels you!

955
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,800
She is now...

956
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,040
my bride!

957
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,720
More light!

958
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:57,640
Light! More light!

959
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,200
Unclean.

960
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,320
- Get them!
- This way!

961
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,880
- Get them!
- They must be found.

962
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:12,880
Unclean.

963
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,480
We have learned something much.

964
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,200
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

965
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,360
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

966
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,120
He is gone.

967
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,480
How do you know?

968
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,240
He speaks to me.

969
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,600
He has a strong
mind connection to you.

970
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,440
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

971
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,680
- You admire him.
<i>- Ja.</i>

972
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:46,960
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

973
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,720
and his mind
was great and powerful...

974
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,680
but greater is the necessity
to stamp him out...

975
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,600
and destroy him utterly.

976
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,560
- Doctor?
<i>- Ja?</i>

977
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,040
I know that I am
becoming like him.

978
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:07,480
Your salvation
is his destruction.

979
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,200
That is why
I want to hypnotize you.

980
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:15,160
I want you to help me find him
before it is too late.

981
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,680
Please, help me find him.
Please.

982
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,120
Look into this light...

983
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,800
the light of all light,
into this flame.

984
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,680
Your eyes are heavy.

985
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,840
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

986
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,440
- Sleep.
- I must go to him.

987
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,840
He calls.

988
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,280
What do you hear?

989
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,880
What do you hear, child?

990
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,480
<i>What do you hear?</i>

991
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:53,560
<i>Oh, my prince is calling me.</i>

992
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,040
<i>He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.</i>

993
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,200
<i>There he will grow strong again.</i>

994
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,840
<i>I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.</i>

995
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:15,080
<i>We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...</i>

996
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,160
<i>"28th October"
no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.</i>

997
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:22,520
<i>He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.</i>

998
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:26,160
<i>By train, we can reach the Romanian port
at Varna in three days.</i>

999
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,840
<i>By ship, it will take him
at least a week.</i>

1000
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,240
<i>From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.</i>

1001
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,840
<i>The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar...</i>

1002
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,680
<i>where we have posted a lookout...</i>

1003
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,480
<i>and then on to the Black Sea port
in Varna...</i>

1004
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,760
<i>where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.</i>

1005
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,600
Home. Home.

1006
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:04,600
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood...

1007
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,760
and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1008
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,680
It is no use.

1009
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:23,760
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

1010
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1011
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,680
Oh, what have I done to you?

1012
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,400
No, I have done this
to both of us.

1013
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,680
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1014
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,600
He's calling me to him.

1015
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,560
Stay with me. Please.

1016
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,480
I am so cold.

1017
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,640
All aboard!

1018
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:05,320
<i>Noon. Holmwood received a wire
from his clerk at Lloyd's.</i>

1019
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:08,360
<i>The count's ship sailed past us
in the night fog...</i>

1020
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,280
<i>to the northern port of Galatz.</i>

1021
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:13,480
<i>The black devil
is reading Mina's mind.</i>

1022
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,960
How can we catch him now?

1023
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:26,040
Varna. Galatz.

1024
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,760
It's about 200 miles.

1025
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,000
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

1026
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,960
reach him before
he reaches the castle.

1027
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,960
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

1028
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,560
If we fail in our task...

1029
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,480
you will have to finish him.

1030
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,360
<i>From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing
took a carriage...</i>

1031
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,120
<i>and we continued
on the train towards Galatz...</i>

1032
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:52,920
<i>where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.</i>

1033
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,520
<i>I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.</i>

1034
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,240
I know this place.

1035
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:14,000
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1036
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,920
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1037
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,440
No, we must go!

1038
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,120
He needs me.
We must go!

1039
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,280
<i>We have passed Bistritza.</i>

1040
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,000
<i>Dracula has outsmarted us again.</i>

1041
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:32,760
<i>We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz...</i>

1042
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,280
<i>and are now on
the Borgo Pass road.</i>

1043
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,840
- Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1044
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:47,800
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

1045
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,760
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

1046
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,200
She told me.

1047
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:06,200
I, too, know what men desire.

1048
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,000
Will you cut off my head...

1049
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,000
and drive a stake
through my heart...

1050
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,320
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1051
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:36,560
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1052
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,000
You are safe within the circle.

1053
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,520
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1054
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,920
You're whores of Satan!

1055
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,960
This is holy ground.

1056
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,840
Leave this place now!

1057
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,760
Leave!

1058
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,040
In the name of God,
leave this ground!

1059
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,960
I command you
in the name of Christ!

1060
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,320
Christ! Damn you!

1061
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,800
Dracul!

1062
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,960
You are...

1063
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:50,360
near.

1064
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,280
My love.

1065
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,280
They're racing
against the sunset.

1066
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,200
It may be too late.
God help us.

1067
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,320
Harker, shoot!

1068
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,360
Charge!

1069
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,920
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1070
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,000
Will you?

1071
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,640
- Wait.
- Let them go.

1072
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:51,520
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1073
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,760
Hers has just begun.

1074
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,560
We've all become God's madmen.

1075
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,800
All of us.

1076
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,360
Where is my god?

1077
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,520
He has forsaken me.

1078
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,640
It is finished.

1079
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,480
My love.

1080
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:57,920
My love.

1081
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,600
<i>There, in the presence of God...</i>

1082
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:11,240
<i>I understood at last
how my love could release us all...</i>

1083
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:13,160
<i>from the powers of darkness.</i>

1084
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,720
<i>Our love is stronger than death.</i>

1085
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,360
Give me peace.

1086
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,098
